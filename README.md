# FE13_FileMenuSwitch
Pressing "Continue" will take you to the "delete file" menu
Pressing "Delete" will take you to the "load file" menu, the load menu is non-functional

I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ACCIDENTALLY DELETED FILES

the purpose of me making this is for me to better understand how FE13's menus function
