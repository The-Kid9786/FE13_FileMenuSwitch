# FE13_FileMenuSwitch
US GAME VERSION

Pressing "Continue" will take you to the "delete file" menu
Pressing "Delete" will take you to the "load file" menu, the load menu is non-functional

I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ACCIDENTALLY DELETED FILES

the purpose of me making this is for me to better understand how FE13's menus function

Applying the patch (in citra):

plaace code.ips in the mods folder

the path should look like mods\00040000000A0500\code.ips

I am not familiar with how to load mods onto real hardware nor do I know what the risks are
to real hardware if there are any
